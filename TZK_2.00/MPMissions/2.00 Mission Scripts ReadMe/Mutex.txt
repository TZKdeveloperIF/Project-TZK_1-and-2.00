The "@" script command is quite useful. It can guarantee scripts using same mutex bool variable being executed one by one and protect critical designs need to work sequential.
Most of these bool variables are named starting with "mutex" but this is unnecessary for OFP, however it's recommend for editing.
Mutex bool variables mostly defined in Init series scripts especially in InitPublicVariables.
