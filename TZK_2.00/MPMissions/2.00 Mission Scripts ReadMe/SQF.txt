SQF is high efficiency. It's strongly recommend to use SQF optimizing CTI mission when editing scripts. Of course it'll be a huge project making CTI full of SQF but transfer those editing SQS into SQF may finally complete this idea someday step by step.

However, SQF in OFP don't support "sleep" and "waituntil" function thus it's necessary to use SQS. Using SQS as a controller to ask SQF do dirty works maybe a good choice. SQF has a return value and it can be used to sort codes' executing.
