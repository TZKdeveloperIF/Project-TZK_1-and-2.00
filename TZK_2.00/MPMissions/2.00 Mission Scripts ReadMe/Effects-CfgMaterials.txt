The effect of CfgMaterials can be defined in config.cpp in ANY AddOns, that is, unnecessary to override the Bin\config in mods.

However the CfgMaterials Effect is invalid to those objects created during a mission, and most units in CTI is created in game, not on start. Luckily if player ALT+TAB twice those EXISTED objects will gain the effects, and a texture gained the Effect will keep on working on new spawned object. Thus a solution shows up: to create all vehicles in the beginning then players can easily ALT+TAB twice then all objects created later will have effects.

Check Server\MaterialEffectVehicles.sqs for more info.




Effects are merged in TZK_Effects. The critical material effect is defined by CfgMaterials. Add textures to CfgTextureToMaterial can make the texture have the material effect.
Files used in TZK_Effects deleted many textures unused in 2.00 TZK CTI mission. The original files of ofp_matdef packaged in folder as well and it includes more textures from addons. Editor can fill more texture to it by himself. And it's a way to search for ideal addon reminded by texture's path defined in ofp_matdef.
But be aware: too many textures listed in CfgTextureToMaterial will make game stuck.
