The latest TZK missions used models from addons. Aiming to reduce files' volume files packaged in addons pbo are edited, critical files such as model p3d, texture paa/pac and sound files are remained while others mostly be deleted. If you want to use mods based on TZK, please set your mod right of TZK mod in "-mod" parameter, for example, @TZK_1.11;@your_mod_name, to make sure pbo files in your mod cover name-same file in TZK mod.
Some edited addons' config file remain only CfgPatches for OFP and CTI-mission to recognize. These same-name CfgPatches may cheat OFP if you used them for other missions except TZK CTI requiring same-name addons(CfgPatches, actually). REMEMBER, addons here are edited and most of them is different from original version thus DONT USE THEM EXCEPT TZK_CTI.
