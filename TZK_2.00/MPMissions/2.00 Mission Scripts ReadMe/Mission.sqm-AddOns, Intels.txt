AddOns[]
"AddOns[]" defines necessary addon for mission. Game will check addons' CfgPatches name and kick players lack of addons listed here in assign window.
It's unnecessary to list all addons here if players without some critical addons can play normally.
There widely exists wrong island addon requirement in C8 missions. Thus I suggest mission editors at least check the island-addon(s)-requirement in "Addons[]" list.

Edit briefingName and briefingDescription here. It's not recommended to change the resistanceWest, weather and data/time parameters. The reason date be set at Sept. 22th, the Autumnal Equinox, is that sun rise and fall at 6:00 and 18:00 on this day. And in Init.sqs, game time plus 6 hours for each kind of time(day, dusk, night, dawn) thus 11:00 is a proper time.
