If a vehicle has no weapons and no magazines in config, AI won't attack any longer even though they're equipped later in-game. Thus it's necessary to define magazines for them and remove it just when it's created.

Aircrafts in TZK have the "SpoofMagazine" as magazine thus won't encounter this problem. Editors may check "CfgVehicles_Light_inherit.hpp" for more info.
