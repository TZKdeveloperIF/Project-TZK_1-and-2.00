TZK_2.00 used to lag after having started about 50mins. The reason is remote-data-reading. For example, those missile launch effect will create smoke and flame on the position of missile, and this will ask remote client to keep on reading position and velocity of remote missile. Another reason may be EventHandlers executed on dedicated server, which caused unnecessary data transform among clients and the server.
Actually most effects added into TZK_2.00 is simply transplanted from existed famous mod, however it proved that they're not reliable in multiplayer game.

The latest TZK_2.00 managed to adjust most effects. Most EventHandlers is added by "Init" via "addEventHandler" separately and won't add in dedicated server. Effects are edited and avoid possible high frequency remote-data-reading. For instance scripts of "Killed" vehicle has a sentence using "@"(WaitUntil), which is a command will be checked every frame, and this time it's placed by delay. As for killed aircraft, only local client will @ it's altitude less than 5 then publicVariable the killed aircraft. And most bullet/missile effects will be visable-local-only while only M109/2S25 effects remained.
