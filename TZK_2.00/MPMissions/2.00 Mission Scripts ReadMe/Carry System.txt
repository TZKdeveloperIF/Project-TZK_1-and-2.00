The type of variables able to publish/broadcast in OFP is quite limited. Array isn't support. Thus CTI use carry system to restore more than one numbers' info into one number varialbe then publish it.

TZK set some of the carry as a constant in Init series scripts aims to make it easier to edit. The number in OFP scripts is single precision floating-point thus can't be too large (should be less than 16777216), so a PublicVariable large enough should be divided into two or more variables if wish to raise the carry.
The carry should always more than infos' total numbers. For example, we use decimal system which can restore 0~9 in each digit.
