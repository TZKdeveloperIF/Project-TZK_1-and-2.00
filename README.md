# Project TZK_1 and TZK_2.00
Record of TZK_1 series and TZK_2.00 Mod and MPMissions

TZK_1.01 is the first step modifying crCTI missions of XR.
TZK_1.02 fixed some bugs.
TZK_1.10 applying EventHandlers to Server Units(units of AI teams).

TZK_2.00 make many changes and attempts.
Introduction of new models like Leo2A6, M1A2, T90, ZTZ99, M109, PLZ05 is inspired by SE mod of TZK whose author is Dr.StrangeLove, Escobar and Mac_Evil_Remi.
Temporary Order System is designed to enhance original "Order" system in old missions.
Join System is designed to pass units among groups/clients.
Effects basing on EventHandler and CfgMaterials are introduced.
Models are get better re-edit.

Those changes and attempts sometimes work instable in TZK_2.00, thus have to be updated frequently. The author finally realized that the MOD should be well defined and store as many as possible stable and basic resources, and their usage should be defined in MPMissions, as the result, the mod won't(and not recommended) need to be updated frequently, editor need only to upgrade/fix missions.
